# selenium-bestbuy-checkout

Hello, I made this checkout bot for Best Buy using selenium 3.141.0 and python 3.8 on a Mac. 
It allowed me to further my knowledge using Selenium, Python, and the use of virtual environments.
It uses Google Chrome version 91.0 as the web browser and the package webdriver.
The program is designed to take you to the product you wish to purchase, scraping the page for adding the item to cart, checking out using your email, and confirming 
your credit card information on file. 

A useful command to initialize the virtual environment: 
. venv/bin/activate

A useful command to trust the chromedriver if error occurs:
$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver
